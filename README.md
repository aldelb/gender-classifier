To run these files you would need to add three folders : 
* the data folder, which you can create with explanations from this github: [FairGenderGen](https://github.com/aldelb/FairGenderGen)
* the generated data folder: the csv files corresponding to the gaze, head movements and AUs generated by your models. Exemple here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IfXOXlcB44t9sFjk0yZqFI9zJoUwZiYk?hl=fr
* the saved_models folder containing the trained classifiers, which you can download here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KlytbvuCfaSSgD35Tlq4QDTQNCuNLXai?hl=fr
